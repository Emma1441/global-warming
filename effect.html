<h2>Effects of Global Warming</h2>
<p> Global warming is going to have lasting and devestating effects on the Earth. Every year is hotter than the last, animals are changing their migrating patterns, the polar ice caps and glaciers 
are melting at alraming rates. Extreme weather patterns, droughts and fires are all increasing and the oceans are rising as well as acidifying. 
Climate scientists say we only have until 2040 when global warming will become irreversible.</p>

<p>Average temperatures are higher than the year before. Each new year breaks the heat record.
The average temperature increase is only 1.78 degress fahrenheit warmer than in the 20th century, and that doesn't seem like much hotter, but that small change is the cause of so much damage.</p>

 <p>That small change in temperature is throwing off the balance of the seasons for animals and plants. Trees bud earlier in spring and lose their leaves later in fall.
Animals are migrating closer to the poles to escape the rising climate and tropical fish are leaving their reefs for cooler waters. 
Birds are flying to feeding and nesting grounds earlier and tropical pests and diseases are leaving their tropical areas, 
killing off plants, animals and humans who have not been exposed before, causing many excintions.</p>

<p> The polar ice caps and glaciers are melting at alarming rates. When ice levels were measured in October of 2019, 
scientists found there was 1.04 million square miles below the average of 1981-2010. Permafrost, ice that is permanatly frozen, 
is thawing and is causing landslides and mudslides.</P>

<p> 1.78 degrees fahrenheit isn't a small differnce, is it?</p>
