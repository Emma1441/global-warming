<h2>What it is: </h2>

<p> A gradual increase in the overall temperature of the earth's atmosphere generally attributed to the greenhouse effect caused by increased levels of carbon dioxide, chlorofluorocarbons, and other pollutants. </p>

<h2> The Evidence/Stats: </h2>
<p> according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA): Average surface temperatures rose a total of 1.71 degrees Fahrenheit between 1880 and 2016. The pace of change has been an additional 0.13 degrees F  per decade, with the land surface warming faster than the ocean surface â€” 0.18 degrees F versus 0.11 degrees F per decade, respectively.

Impact of global warming: extreme weather. Hurricanes and typhoons are expected to become more intense as the planet warms. Hotter oceans evaporate more moisture, which is the engine that fuels these storms. Facts :</p>


<ul>

<li>Carbon dioxide levels in the atmosphere are at 406.5 ppm as of 2017, their highest levels in 650,000 years. </li>
<li>Average global temperature is up 1.7 degrees F (0.94 degrees C) since 1880. </li>
<li>The minimum expanse of Arctic summer sea ice has declined 13.3 percent per decade since the 1980s. </li>
<li>Land ice has declined at the poles by 286 gigatons a year since 2002. </li>
<li>Global sea level has risen 7 inches (176 millimeters) in the past century. </li>
